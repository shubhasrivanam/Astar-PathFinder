# Astar-PathFinder
Based on A* algorithm
By: Shubhasri Vanam 

This project was inspired from A* Path Finding Algorithm of Coding Train.
A* algorithm helps us to find the shortest path from one location to another.
It is based of a general formula i.e., f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
where,
n refers to the cell. It is taken as an input.
g(n) is the time it takes from the starting point to the current point
h(n) called as the heuristic is guessing the time it takes from the current point to the end.
f(n) is the summation of both of the above.

By calculating f, g, and h it become quite easy to find the shortest path to the end.
All we have to do is the join the cells with the least f(n) value.
